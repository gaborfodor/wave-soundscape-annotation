The model was developed for the [Rainforest Connection Species Audio Detection
](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rfcx-species-audio-detection) kaggle competition,
and it is able to recognize 24 avian and amphibian species collected from El Yunque National Forest, Puerto Rico.

The architecture is slightly modified version of the [CNN14](https://github.com/qiuqiangkong/audioset_tagging_cnn) pretrained on audioset [1].

In the kaggle forums more details can be found about [how we used this app to collect more training labels](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rfcx-species-audio-detection/discussion/220305) or [how we trained our final ensemble](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rfcx-species-audio-detection/discussion/220443).
