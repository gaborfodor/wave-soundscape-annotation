The model was developed for the [Rainforest Connection Species Audio Detection
](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rfcx-species-audio-detection) kaggle competition,
and it is able to recognize 24 species of bird and amphibian.

The architecture is slightly modified version of the [CNN14](https://github.com/qiuqiangkong/audioset_tagging_cnn) pretrained on audioset [1].
